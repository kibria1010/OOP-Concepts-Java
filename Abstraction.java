/**
 * Abstraction in Java is an object-oriented programming concept that focuses on
 * hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary
 * features of an object. It allows developers to focus on 'what' an object does
 * rather than 'how' it does it. This is achieved in Java using abstract classes
 * and interfaces.
